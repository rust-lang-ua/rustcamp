Rust Rustcamp
==============

> "It wasn't always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about _empowerment_: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before."
_<div align="right">Rust Book's Foreword</div>_

In this rustcamp, you will participate in the [Rustcamp], a rigorous, step-by-step Rust certification program üèÜ. The aim of this program is to shape you into a proficient **Strong Junior** Rust Developer. Indeed, with this rigorous training, you will find yourself better prepared than developers switching from other languages without a similar level of instruction. If you are a mid- or senior-level developer transitioning to Rust, you can confidently target **Middle-level** positions after achieving this certification.

| Description                     | Number |
|---------------------------------|-------:|
| Total applications to Rustcamp  |    507 |
| Total number of Participants    |    187 |
| Mentors    |    38 |
| Certified Professionals         |     40 |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the certification program, you should have a solid understanding of Rust and Git/GitHub. We strongly recommend completing the [Rust Book]. It's also beneficial if you have completed [Rustlings] and [Exercism], and have some hands-on practice. If you're transitioning from another programming language, you'll also find this certification program particularly useful.

## Process

Participants in the boot camp will be divided into closely-knit small groups. Meetings within these groups will occur four times a week, excluding weekends. These meetings are an opportunity for dynamic discussion, mutual learning, and answering any questions you might have. Additionally, participants can expect to answer insightful questions posed by their mentors, fostering a proactive learning environment.

Our learning process is designed around daily skill enhancement, leveraging the highest quality learning materials available. We provide an interactive platform for tracking progress, ensuring a clear path of advancement and accomplishment.

Participants will also be challenged with designing, developing, and presenting a capstone project. This project provides a fantastic opportunity to apply the skills learned throughout the boot camp in a practical, impactful way.

Finally, a comprehensive assessment will be conducted at the end of the certification program. Upon successful completion, participants will earn a certificate. This certificate is more than just a document; it's a testament to your ability to utilize best practices and write idiomatic code that employers will value highly. Imagine the doors that could open with this certificate in hand!

### Schedule

Each task must be performed as a separate [PR (pull request)][PR] with an appropriate name and checkmarked here in README's schedule after completion. Each task is a [Cargo workspace member][13], so you can run/test it from the project root (i.e. `cargo run -p task_1_8`). __Consider to use [rustfmt] and [Clippy] when you're writing [Rust] code.__

Each task has the estimated time for completion. If any deeper investigation on task's theme is needed by you, then it's on your own.

Do not hesitate to ask your mentor/lead with questions, however you won't receive any concrete answer, but rather a direction for your own investigation. _Mentor/Lead is the one who asks questions here, demanding concrete and complete answers._
